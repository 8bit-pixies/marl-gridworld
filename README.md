# MARL Gridworld

Multi-Agent Reinforment Learning (MARL) over grid world environments primarily for RLlib environment structures. 

This repository contains the base gridworld environments, in which I intend on building multiple variants in the future.

The intention is to keep the environments simple, so that they can be easily extended or even procedurally generated in the future.
